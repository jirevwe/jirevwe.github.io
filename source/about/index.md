# About

## Me

Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Raymond Tukpe. I am a seasoned software engineer with over 8 years of professional experience. I graduated top of my class with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria. I have a strong background in software engineering and technical leadership, and have worked at multiple companies and startups, building complex enterprise software and delivering successful products across a range of industries, including EdTech, Fintech, Gaming, and TradeTech.

## Work
I am passionate about creating sustainable, impactful and innovative products. One of my proudest achievements was building [Gomoney](https://gomoney.global/), a neobank at Sterling Bank, which was heavily influenced by Monzo in the UK. Building a bank in the cloud was incredibly exciting, and the transparency with which Monzo was built set the standard for how I wanted to approach my own product development. [Gomoney](https://gomoney.global/) is a highly successful product and is used by a large number of Nigerians every day. As the technology lead at [Gomoney](https://gomoney.global/), I led and coordinated multiple engineering teams to build innovative solutions into the product, and worked closely with the product, finance, and banking operations teams on strategy and other technical support functions. I am also passionate about giving back to the community, which has led me to train and mentor interns upskilling them to capable software engineers in and outside of work.

I am also very proud of my work on [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io/), where I serve as CTO. [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io/) is an open source developer tooling company that enables software product companies of all sizes to send and receive webhook events. [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io/) was accepted into Y-Combinator's winter batch in 2022 and raised over $900K in venture capital. At [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io/), we are building world-class open-source technology that will have a positive impact on how teams build and architect products.  At [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io/) I wear multiple hats, leading product development (engineering and infrastructure) while also working on content for our blog, managing the community and planning/scoping out the companyâ€™s short-long term strategy. As of today, [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io/) boasts over 930 Github stars, a community of over 170 developers, over 10 active customers in the US, India, Africa, and the EU using our cloud platform, and has published and received millions of webhook events for users worldwide just over 12 months after its public release.
