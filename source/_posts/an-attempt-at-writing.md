I've been struggling to put my thoughts down consistently for a long time. This is not because I don't want to, but because I don't know how to fit into my current schedule. hopefully I get better at it gradually.

I would be writing about things I think about (conpepts and opinions) and things I'm working on or hope to work on. I will not write only about technology because I'm not a programmer first, I'm a human who is a programmer. We'll see how it goes. I don't have any goals for writing, but I do want to write.

See you in the next one.
